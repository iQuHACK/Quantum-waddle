    "### Introduction\n",
    "Classical random walks are used widely in graph searching and optimization, with many important applications in route planning, game playing, physics, and finance. This motivates researchers to look at the quantum analogue of a random walk, a quantum walk. \n",
    "\n",
    "A simple random walk example consists of a 1D chain whose nodes are enumerated by integer values and connected to its two adjacent neighbors. A random walker in position $i$ steps to either $i+1$ or $i-1$ depending on the outcome of a coin flip. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the quantum mechanical analogue, we consider evolution of position on a lattice conditioned on the spin state of a spin-1/2 system.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/random_walk.png\" width=700px>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "One primary motivation is to determine whether quantum computers are faster at solving problems than classical computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to 2003, exponential speedup was only demonstrated on algorithms that depended on the quantum Fourier transform. It's an interesting question to determine whether there is algorithmic variety in exponential speed up. It turns out that quantum walks can exhibit an exponential speed up[3].\n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper[3] by Childs, *et al.*, they define the graph traversal problem. The idea is that if they implement graphs encoded via *so called* black box functions, they demonstrate that for certain complicated graphs, quantum walks can traverse the graph exponentially faster than any classical algorithm.\n",
    "Our desire was to implement a quantum walk in IBM's quantum computer, starting in particularly simple cases and then work our way up to the full fledged case. As determining actual circuit configurations in a real quantum computer is a non-trivial problem we followed the work given in [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantum Walk on a Lattice\n",
    "\n",
    "The state of the system evolves with the application of two unitary operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A coin flip operator\n",
    "2. A conditional shift operator\n",
    "\n",
    "The state of our system $\\vert \\Psi \\rangle$ is the product state of the coin and the position on the lattice\n",
    "$\\vert \\Psi \\rangle = \\vert s \\rangle \\otimes \\vert \\psi \\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coin space: $\\vert s \\rangle \\in \\mathcal{H}_C = \\{ \\vert \\uparrow \\rangle, \\vert \\downarrow \\rangle \\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Position space: $ \\vert \\psi \\rangle = \\mathcal{H}_P = \\{ \\sum_{i \\in Z} \\alpha_i \\vert i \\rangle \\} $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hadamard coin\n",
    "\n",
    "For a walk on a chain, the coin flip operator is a $2 \\times 2$ unitary matrix. A typical choice would be the Hadamard coin,\n",
    "\n",
    "$H = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1\\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Shift operator\n",
    "\n",
    "The shift operator S is a position translating operator conditioned on the coin as the control qubit. It increments the position by one if the particle is in the spin up state, and decrements by one if the particle is in the spin down state:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ S = \\sum_{i \\in Z} \\mid i + 1 \\rangle \\langle i \\mid \\otimes \\vert \\uparrow \\rangle \\langle \\uparrow \\vert + \\vert i - 1 \\rangle \\langle i \\vert \\otimes \\vert \\downarrow \\rangle \\langle \\downarrow \\vert $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Single time step\n",
    "If the system is initialized in the state $\\vert \\Psi \\rangle = \\vert \\uparrow \\rangle \\otimes \\vert 0 \\rangle$,\n",
    "\n",
    "a single time step involves the application of a Hadamard coin flip\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vert \\uparrow \\rangle \\otimes \\vert 0 \\rangle \\xrightarrow{H} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2} \\big( \\vert \\uparrow \\rangle + \\vert \\downarrow \\rangle \\big) \\otimes \\vert 0 \\rangle $\n",
    "\n",
    "followed by a conditional shift\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\xrightarrow{S} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2} \\big( \\vert \\uparrow \\rangle \\otimes \\vert 1 \\rangle  + \\vert \\downarrow \\rangle \\otimes \\vert -1 \\rangle \\big) $"

The paper doesn't illustrate how to implement the actual black box function, so we came up with an algorithmic way to implement any black box function.\n",
